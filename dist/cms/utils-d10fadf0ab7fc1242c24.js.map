reducer 组成\n  3.2 preloadedState 是 一个初始化的state，为 空对象 或者 一个预定好的state(当使用ssr方案时由服务器端提供, 以达到数据状态同步)\n  3.3 enhancer 由 redux 的 compose() 生成，主要是 传入中间件 来加强reducer\n  4 每个组件的数据状态 由 一个state 来管理, preloadState 与 state 的关系为包含, 可以把整个store想象成一棵树, 树的节点就是state, 而每个需要有数据管理的组件都对应着一个state\n  4.1 一般会初始化state, 如命名为 initialState, 提供默认值\n  4.2 初始化一个react组件的时候, 需要用 react-redux 提供的 connect() 将 state 和 dispatch 绑定到 组件的 props 上, 接收的两个参数是函数，为 mapStateToProps 和 mapDispatchToProps，意味着这样才能在react组件中 调用或者访问 store 中对应的state中的数据\n  4.3 bindActionsCreators() 只是一个封装，实质上还是会 dispatch(action)\n  4.4 dispatch(action) 是从 react组件中 改变state的唯一方法，派发 action后，store收到并给出一个新的 state，state的计算过程就叫 reducer, 所以reducer的第一个参数是 旧的state，第二个参数是 action，即在旧的state上做一个action产生新的state\n  4.5 state改变后, store就会调用监听函数 subscribe(listener), listener中会
